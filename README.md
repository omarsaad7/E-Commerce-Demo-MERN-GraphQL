### API Reference

### Deployment

Deployment made using Vercel for frontend and Render for backend
* [Front-end](https://sports-hub-livid.vercel.app/)

* [Back-end](https://e-commerce-demo.onrender.com)  

Note: Render free deployment used makes the app sleeps after a while of not using it. So backend deployment takes a little bit longer time for the first api call as it starts the application
